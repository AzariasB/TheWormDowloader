# The worm downloader

Utility script to download the worm novel from the website
and convert it to a single pdf, optimized for ereader with a 14 pt font and medium margins

The script waits between each downloads to avoid flooding the site with requests.

```

Wait for the script to finish downloading the html and converting to html and, you're done.
